    "The orginal problem(policy) is I have 3 supervisors who are checking if the assigned experiments were done by the 3 labs ( lab 1, lab2 , and lab 3) when the 3 supervisors pass every 2 hours all the days, meaning that 12 visits are the max number of visits per day. However, the problem is passing every 2 hours results in finding some of the labs are either already done and are waiting or other labs are still finishing their assigned experiments. And the labs cannot be assigned another experiment unless they already done of their preivous assigned experiment. My policy was to generate random numbers, which follow an exponential distribution in terms of a matrix of a dimention of (12*3). As 12  refers to the # of supervisors' visits and 3 refers to # of labs represented in the data frame named as df. After that, to solve the problem that some laps will not have finished when the supervisors come, their needed left time will be shifted to the following column. Whereas, the already done labs will be assigned a new experiment to finish. I used the bootstrapping technique to examine which is the ideal time for the 3 supervisiors to pass by the labs. By taking the 75th percentile, I am suggesting that at least 2 of the labs will be finished when the superviors pass every during the most repeative time in minutes and this is my policy ."
